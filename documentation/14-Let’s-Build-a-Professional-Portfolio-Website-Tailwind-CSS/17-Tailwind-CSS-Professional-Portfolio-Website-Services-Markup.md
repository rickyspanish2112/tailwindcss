<div>
  <h6>why choose me</h6>
  <h2>Best Services for you</h2>
</div>
```

- `<h6>` and `<h2>`: These headings introduce the services section. The `<h6>` adds a small title ("why choose me"), while the `<h2>` highlights the main focus ("Best Services for you"). 🏅🎯
- Purpose: These headings provide a clear introduction to the section, setting the tone for the services being offered. 🎨✨

3. Service Description:

    eveniet, doloribus impedit
  </p>
  <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Praesentium</p>
</div>
