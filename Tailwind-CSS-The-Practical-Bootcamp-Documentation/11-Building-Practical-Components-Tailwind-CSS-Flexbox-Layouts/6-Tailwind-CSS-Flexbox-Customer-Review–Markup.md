## 🔄 3. Flow of the Document

The document's flow follows a structured pattern to ensure the content is logically presented:

1. Main Title: The document begins with the `<h1>` tag for "Most recent reviews." This gives the user context, introducing the purpose of the section.
2. Review Section: Within the `<section>` element, each review is represented as a `<div>`. This creates a natural flow of multiple reviews listed vertically.
3. Each Review:
   - Each review has three parts:
     - Review Metadata: Includes the star rating, a numeric rating value, and the review date.
     - Review Content: Consists of the title and the actual customer feedback.
     - User Information and Interactions: Contains the user's name, thumbs-up count, and a "Reply" option.
4. Repeated Structure: The structure is repeated for each review, making it scalable for multiple reviews on the page.

## 💡 4. Purpose of Each Section

### 1. Main Heading (`<h1>`)

- The heading is the main title of the section, which informs the user that they are viewing recent customer reviews.

### 2. Review Section (`<section>`)

- The section contains the core content of the reviews. It serves as the container for all the individual review blocks.

### 3. Review Container (`<div>`)

- Each review is enclosed in a `<div>`. This separation makes it easier to manage the layout and style of individual reviews.

### 4. Review Metadata (`<div>`)

- This part contains the star rating and the review date. It allows users to quickly understand the rating and when the review was written.

### 5. Review Content (`<div>`)

- This includes the review title (e.g., "Not bad") and the customer's actual feedback. It provides insight into the reviewer's thoughts.

### 6. User Info and Interactions (`<div>`)

- The last section of each review shows the user's name, an avatar icon, thumbs-up count, and a reply option, encouraging interaction with the review.

## 🧩 5. Starter Component Use Cases

This starter component can be used in a variety of applications:

- Testimonial Pages: Displaying customer reviews and testimonials for a product or service.
- E-commerce Product Reviews: Showing customer feedback on individual product pages.
- Blog Comments: Used as a structure for displaying comments and feedback on blog posts or articles.
- Community Platforms: Providing a framework for users to leave feedback and rate content on community-driven platforms.
