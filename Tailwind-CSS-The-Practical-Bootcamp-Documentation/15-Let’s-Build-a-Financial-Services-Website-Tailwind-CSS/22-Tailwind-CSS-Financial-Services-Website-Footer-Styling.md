## 🚀 Purpose and Flow of the Document

The Footer Section provides essential information about the company, including a brief description and contact details. It serves as a way to conclude the page, giving users access to important details in a clear, structured format.

### Purpose:

1. **Provide Company Information:**
   The footer includes the company name and a brief description, offering users an understanding of the brand and its purpose.

2. **Easy Access to Contact Details:**
   The contact information is prominently displayed, ensuring that users can easily find the phone number and address for further inquiries.

### Flow of Interaction:

1. **Company Info First:**
   Users are first introduced to the brand name and a brief description, giving them a sense of the company's mission.

2. **Contact Information Next:**
   After the company info, the contact details are presented in a clean, organized layout, making it easy for users to reach out if needed.

## 🤝 Understanding the Relationships

### 1. Parent-Child Relationships:

- The footer acts as the main container for the entire footer section, organizing the content into two distinct columns (company info and contact info).
- Each content block (company and contact) is a child of the grid container, ensuring they are structured neatly and respond to different screen sizes.

### 2. Sizing Relationships:

- The grid layout ensures that the two content blocks are displayed side by side on medium screens and larger, while they stack vertically on smaller screens to maintain readability.

### 3. Color Relationships:

- The text color changes to a lighter shade (primary-500) in dark mode, ensuring the content is readable against the darker background. The blue border in extra-large screens visually separates the footer from other sections.

### 4. Typographical Relationships:

- The company name is the largest and boldest text, drawing the user's attention first, while the contact heading is slightly smaller but still bold, guiding users to the contact information.

### 5. Layout Relationships:

- The grid layout ensures that the company info and contact info are equally spaced and organized, providing a balanced and easily navigable footer on both small and large screens.

## 📝 Additional Notes

- **Responsive Design:**
  The footer is fully responsive, with the grid layout adjusting based on screen size to ensure that the content remains clear and accessible on all devices.

- **Cohesive Design Language:**
  The footer follows the same design principles as the rest of the page, with consistent typography, padding, and color schemes to create a unified visual experience.
