  <h2>I am experienced in the following fields</h2>
</div>
```

- `<h6>` and `<h2>`: The smaller heading `<h6>` introduces the skills section ("My Skills"), while the larger heading `<h2>` provides a more descriptive subtitle, explaining what the section is about ("I am experienced in the following fields"). These help structure the section and introduce its purpose. 🏆🎯
