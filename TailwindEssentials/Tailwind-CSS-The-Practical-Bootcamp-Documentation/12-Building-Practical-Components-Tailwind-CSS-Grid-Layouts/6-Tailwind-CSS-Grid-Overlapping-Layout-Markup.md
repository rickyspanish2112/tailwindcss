Key Elements in the Structure:

- Main Container (`<main>`): The entire layout is wrapped in the `<main>` element, which semantically represents the primary content of the page.
- Figure Elements (`<figure>`): Each `<figure>` tag represents a combination of an image and its caption.
- Image (`<img>`): Inside each figure, there is an image displayed with the `src` attribute pointing to the image URL, and the `alt` attribute providing descriptive text for accessibility.
- Figure Caption (`<figcaption>`): The `<figcaption>` element contains the descriptive text that appears below each image. In this component, all captions are set to "The Beauty of Nature."

## 🔄 3. Flow of the Document

The document is structured to display a series of images, each with a caption. The flow is simple and easy to follow:

1. Main Section: The entire content is wrapped inside the `<main>` element, indicating that this is the primary content for the page.
2. Figure Elements: Each image and its corresponding caption are wrapped in `<figure>` elements, which group the image and text together.
3. Image and Caption Flow:
   - Images are displayed first, providing a visual focus.
   - Captions appear beneath each image, providing a descriptive context for the visuals.
4. Repeated Structure: The structure repeats for each figure, ensuring uniformity across all the images and captions.

This flow ensures that users can easily view each image and understand its associated caption without any interruptions.

## 💡 4. Purpose of Each Section

### 1. Main Section (`<main>`)

- The `<main>` element wraps the entire content of the component. It is a semantic container used to represent the main content of the webpage, ensuring that screen readers and search engines understand the significance of the enclosed content.

### 2. Figure Section (`<figure>`)

- Each `<figure>` tag groups an image and its caption together, forming a self-contained unit. This is important for accessibility and semantic correctness, as it links the image and caption in a meaningful way.
- It also makes styling easier by keeping the image and caption bundled together.

### 3. Image (`<img>`)

- The `<img>` tag is used to display the image. The `src` attribute points to the URL of the image, while the `alt` attribute provides alternative text that describes the image for accessibility purposes (e.g., screen readers).

### 4. Figure Caption (`<figcaption>`)

- The `<figcaption>` element provides a description or title for each image. In this component, the caption "The Beauty of Nature" appears below each image, giving the user context about the content of the image.

## 🧩 5. Starter Component Use Cases

This starter component can be used for various applications, such as:

- Image Galleries: This structure is ideal for image galleries where you want to display images with descriptions.
- Portfolios: Artists, photographers, or designers can use this layout to showcase their work, with captions describing each piece.
