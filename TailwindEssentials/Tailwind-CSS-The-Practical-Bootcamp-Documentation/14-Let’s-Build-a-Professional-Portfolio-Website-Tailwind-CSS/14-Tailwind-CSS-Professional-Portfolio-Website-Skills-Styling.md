## 🚀 Purpose and Flow of the Document

### 🧱 Layout

The Skills Section uses a flexbox layout to arrange text and visuals side by side. On larger screens, the image appears on the right, and the text content is displayed on the left. The section adjusts responsively, stacking the content vertically on smaller screens.

### 🏗️ Structure

This section is divided into two primary parts: the text block and the image. The text block contains the section heading, a description, and skill bars that visually represent proficiency levels in different areas.

### 🎯 Flow of Interaction

Users are introduced to the section with a heading, followed by a description. The skill bars provide an interactive and visual way to represent proficiency, engaging the user and guiding them through the text.

### 🎨 Visual Hierarchy

The section heading and skill titles are emphasized with bold text, while the skill bars stand out due to their horizontal progress indicators. The image balances the text, adding visual interest to the section.

## 🤝 Understanding the Relationships

- Parent-Child Relationships:
  The section container wraps the text and figure, with the text block containing headings, descriptions, and skill bars. The figure adds a visual element.

- Sizing Relationships:
  The skill bars are sized proportionally based on proficiency, and the section adjusts padding and spacing responsively.

- Color Relationships:
  The accent color is used to highlight headings and skill titles, while the secondary color is used for the background of the progress bars.

- Layout Relationships:
  The flexbox layout ensures that text and images are arranged in a balanced manner, reversing the order on larger screens for better visual impact.

## 📝 Additional Notes

- The section is responsive, stacking the content vertically on smaller screens and aligning it horizontally on larger screens. 📱💻
- The skill bars provide a clear, interactive way to represent skill proficiency visually. 🎯
- Tailwind's utility-first approach makes it easy to adjust and customize this section as needed. 🚀
