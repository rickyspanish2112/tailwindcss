## 🏗️ 2. HTML Structure Breakdown

Here's the complete HTML code for this component:

```html
<section>
  <div>
    <blockquote
      cite="https://www.azquotes.com/author/8044-Martin_Luther_King_Jr/tag/brother"
    >
      <p>
        We've learned to fly the air like birds, we've learned to swim the seas
        like fish, and yet we haven't learned to walk the earth as brothers and
        sisters.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>— Martin Luther King, Jr., Love</p>
  </div>
</section>
```

Now, let's break this down into its core elements and explain each part in detail:

1. Section and Container:

```html
<section>
  <div></div>
</section>
```

- `<section>`: This HTML tag is used to define a thematic grouping of content, in this case, the motto section. It organizes the quote into its own block on the webpage. 📦
- `<div>`: The div container holds the blockquote and citation inside a cohesive block. The `<div>` here is a non-semantic element used to group content for layout purposes. 🚪

2. Blockquote and Citation:

```html
<blockquote
  cite="https://www.azquotes.com/author/8044-Martin_Luther_King_Jr/tag/brother"
>
  <p>
    We've learned to fly the air like birds, we've learned to swim the seas like
    fish, and yet we haven't learned to walk the earth as brothers and sisters.
  </p>
</blockquote>
```

- `<blockquote>`: This element is used to enclose the quote. The cite attribute provides a reference URL where the quote can be verified, following best practices for attributing quotations in HTML. ✨📖
- `<p>`: The actual text of the quote is inside a paragraph tag. The quote here is displayed prominently and stylistically formatted by default. 💬

3. Attribution:

```html
<p>— Martin Luther King, Jr., Love</p>
```

- Attribution Paragraph: This paragraph provides the name of the person being quoted (Martin Luther King, Jr.). The long dash (—) is a typographic convention for separating the quote from the name of the speaker. 🖋️📜
- `<cite>`: This tag is used to reference the title of the work from which the quote is taken. Here, it references Love, which is the context in which this quote was used. The ` element is essential for proper quotation attribution in HTML. 📖✨

## 🔄 3. Flow of the Document

The flow of this component is designed to guide the reader's attention to the message of the quote. Here's how it works:

1. The quote is presented immediately and prominently in a blockquote format, catching the reader's attention. 🧐💡
2. Attribution to the author follows the quote, giving credit where it's due and allowing the reader to reflect on the words of a historical figure. 🎤📜
3. The cite link (if styled) can be used to offer additional context or verification for the quote. 🔗

## 💡 4. Purpose of Each Section

- Section: Organizes the quote and its attribution into a single cohesive block. 📦
- Blockquote: Displays the quote in a visually distinct manner, adding emphasis to its content. 💬✨
- Citation and Attribution: Provides the necessary credit to the original speaker and source. This is important for ethical use of quotations on websites. 📜✔️

## 🧩 5. Starter Component Use Cases
