## 🗂️ Element Hierarchy Overview

- `<section>` – Motto section container (p-6 bg-secondary)
  - `<div>` – Content wrapper (p-2 flex flex-col)
    - `<blockquote>` – Blockquote element for the quote (cite)
      - `<p>` – Quotation text (before:content-['\201C'] after:content-['\201D'])
    - `<p>` – Author attribution (text-center font-bold)

## 🚀 Purpose and Flow of the Document

### 🧱 Layout

The motto section is designed to occupy a prominent space on the page, with generous padding and a centered layout. It ensures the quote by Martin Luther King, Jr. is visually emphasized, while the surrounding space makes it easy to focus on the content. The padding adapts for different screen sizes, maintaining readability and balance.

### 🏗️ Structure

The section is structured with a blockquote for the quote, followed by an attribution paragraph for the author. This structure provides clear semantic meaning, with the quote being the main focal point and the author emphasized afterward. The container also utilizes flexbox to ensure vertical alignment of the content, and pseudo-elements are used to add a decorative underline beneath the quote.

### 🎯 Flow of Interaction

Although this section is largely informational, the interaction lies in the visual hierarchy and ease of reading. The centered layout and large font sizes guide the reader's eyes to the quote first, followed by the author attribution. The decorative line under the quote provides a visual stopping point, making the entire section feel complete and balanced.

### 🎨 Visual Hierarchy

The large text sizes and centered content create a clear visual hierarchy, where the quote is the main focus. The use of pseudo-elements adds subtle visual enhancement, while the contrast between the secondary background and the text color ensures legibility.

## 🤝 Understanding the Relationships

- **Parent-Child Relationships:**
  The section container is the parent of the div, which houses the blockquote and author attribution. These elements are vertically stacked within the flex column layout.

- **Sizing Relationships:**
  The padding, text sizes, and pseudo-elements adapt based on the screen size, ensuring the motto is readable and visually balanced on all devices.

- **Color Relationships:**
  The background color and text color create contrast, highlighting the quotation. The pseudo-element adds an extra visual touch below the quote.

## 📝 Additional Notes

- The section is fully responsive, adapting its layout and spacing across various screen sizes. 📱💻
- The use of Tailwind's utility-first approach ensures the design remains easy to adjust and extend. 🚀
- The cite attribute in the blockquote enhances accessibility by referencing the source of the quote. 🌍
