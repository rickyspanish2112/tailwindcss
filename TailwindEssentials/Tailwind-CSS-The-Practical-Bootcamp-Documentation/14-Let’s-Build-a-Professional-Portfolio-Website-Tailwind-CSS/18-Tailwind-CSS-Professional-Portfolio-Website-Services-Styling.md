### 🏗️ Structure

This section begins with a heading and subheading introducing the services, followed by a call-to-action button. The services are listed in a responsive grid, with each service card displaying an image, title, and description.

### 🎯 Flow of Interaction

The user is first introduced to the section with a heading and a brief description of the services. The services grid allows users to view and learn more about each service, with clear calls to action.

### 🎨 Visual Hierarchy

The section heading and subheading are bold and larger, drawing attention. Each service card is presented with a consistent structure: image, title, and description, making the content easy to navigate.

## 🤝 Understanding the Relationships

- Parent-Child Relationships:
  The section container wraps both the text block and the services grid. Each service card contains a figure, title, and description, providing a clear parent-child structure.

- Sizing Relationships:
  The service cards and their contents scale based on screen size, ensuring a responsive layout that maintains readability.

- Color Relationships:
  The accent color is applied to the titles, borders, and buttons, ensuring consistent color usage throughout the section.

- Layout Relationships:
  The flexbox layout allows for responsive alignment, adjusting the position of the grid and text block based on screen size.

## 📝 Additional Notes
