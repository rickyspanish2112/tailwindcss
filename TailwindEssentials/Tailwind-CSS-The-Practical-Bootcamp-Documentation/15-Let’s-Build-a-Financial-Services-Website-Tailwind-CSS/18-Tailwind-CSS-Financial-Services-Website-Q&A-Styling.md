## 🚀 Purpose and Flow of the Document

The Q&A Section is designed to provide users with answers to common questions in an easy-to-read format. Each question is presented in its own block with a distinct color theme, making it visually appealing and ensuring that users can quickly find the information they need.

### Purpose:

1. **Answer Common Questions:**
   This section provides answers to frequently asked questions, offering reassurance and guidance to users who may have concerns or need clarification.

2. **Distinct Visual Style:**
   Each Q&A block uses a different color theme (green, orange, blue) to separate the questions visually, improving the overall readability and user experience.

### Flow of Interaction:

1. **Clear Layout:**
   The grid layout presents two Q&A blocks side by side on larger screens, allowing users to view multiple questions at once without overwhelming them.

2. **Easy-to-Read Blocks:**
   The color-coded headings and answers make it simple for users to scan the section and find the question that relates to their query.

## 🤝 Understanding the Relationships

### 1. Parent-Child Relationships:

- The section acts as the main container for the entire Q&A section, housing all the Q&A blocks.
- Each Q&A block contains a heading (`<h6>`) and an answer (`<p>`), ensuring that the question and answer are grouped together for clarity.

### 2. Sizing Relationships:

- The padding and gap classes (`gap-y-4`, `p-8`) ensure that the content inside each Q&A block is well-spaced, providing adequate room for both the heading and the answer.

### 3. Color Relationships:

- Each Q&A block uses a distinct color theme for the heading and borders:
  - Green: First and fourth Q&A blocks.
  - Orange: Second Q&A block.
  - Blue: Third Q&A block.

### 4. Typographical Relationships:

- The headings are styled with uppercase text and centered alignment, ensuring that the questions are prominent and easy to read.
- The answer text is smaller and more neutral, ensuring that the user's focus remains on the question while still providing the necessary information.

### 5. Layout Relationships:

- The grid layout ensures that the Q&A blocks are presented in a neat two-column format on medium screens and larger, while still maintaining a stacked layout on smaller screens.

## 📝 Additional Notes

- **Dark Mode Support:**
  The Q&A section is fully optimized for dark mode, with each block changing its background, border, and shadow colors to match the dark theme.

- **Consistent Design Language:**
  The section maintains visual consistency with the rest of the page, utilizing the same padding, border-radius, and color palette across the Q&A blocks.
